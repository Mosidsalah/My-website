#### Things to do:

- Indentation! All the code needs to be spaced so we can clearly see what part is in what, and the hierarchy of each item is clear. See the image here to see what I mean: [http://liveditor.com/blog/new-code-visualizing-feature-indentation-guidelines-for-html-code/](http://liveditor.com/blog/new-code-visualizing-feature-indentation-guidelines-for-html-code/)


See how it's clear that the text is inside the h3?


- Put all your content in the body tag -- the body refers to the main part of the webpage, it'll work if you don't follow this but it's terrible practice.  

- The image :) It doesn't load if you don't actually upload the image as a file to github and link to it. Find out how to put the image in the same folder as your code, and link to it in img src  

- Multiple pages  -- I challenge you to add one more HTML file to this folder and link to and from the homepage to this page

- Rename the homepage to index.html for god's sake  

- Move the style stuff to a CSS page, it'll help you make your website look prettier  

- Design!! Please please draw something out and then build from it, right now it looks as if you're learning HTML (which is fair) but the aim is for it to look pro.
